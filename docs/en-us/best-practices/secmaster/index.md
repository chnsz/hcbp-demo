# Introduction

## What is SecMaster

SecMaster is a next-generation cloud native security operations center. Based on years of Huawei Cloud experience in cloud security, it enables integrated and automatic security operations through cloud asset management, security posture management, security information and incident management, security orchestration and automatic response, cloud security overview, simplified cloud security configuration, configurable defense policies, and intelligent and fast threat detection and response.

SecMaster supports custom security playbook rules, achieving automatic identification and response of security events through event trigger mechanisms. Through SecMaster, you can achieve automated analysis, response, and handling of security events, building an intelligent security operations system. Huawei Cloud SecMaster supports seamless integration with multiple security services, including SIEM, SOAR, threat intelligence, etc., providing you with a complete security operations solution.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud SecMaster, helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud SecMaster resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for SecMaster resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated SecMaster deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent security playbook, rule, action management and operation work.
