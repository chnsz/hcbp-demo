# Introduction

## What is Software Repository for Container (SWR)

Software Repository for Container (SWR) is a container image hosting service provided by Huawei Cloud, supporting storage, management, and distribution of Docker images, helping you achieve rapid deployment and continuous integration of container applications. SWR service provides complete container image lifecycle management functions, supporting image building, pushing, pulling, scanning, and deletion operations, meeting full-process requirements of containerized applications.

SWR service supports multiple image repository types, including public repositories and private repositories, supporting image version management and tag management, providing image security scanning and vulnerability detection functions. Through SWR service, you can achieve centralized management, permission control, and access control of container images, building secure and reliable container image repositories. SWR service also supports integration with container orchestration services (such as CCE), achieving automated deployment and continuous delivery of container applications.
