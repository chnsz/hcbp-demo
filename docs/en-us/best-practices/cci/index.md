# Introduction

## What is Cloud Container Instance (CCI)

Cloud Container Instance (CCI) is a Serverless container service provided by Huawei Cloud, allowing you to run container applications directly without creating and managing server clusters. CCI provides second-level startup, pay-as-you-go, and per-second billing container services, supporting Kubernetes native APIs, enabling you to focus on application development without worrying about infrastructure operation and maintenance management.

CCI service supports multiple container images, provides flexible resource configuration and automatic scaling capabilities, and supports seamless integration with services such as VPC and ELB. Through CCI, enterprises can quickly deploy container applications, enjoy the convenience and elasticity of Serverless containers, reduce operation and maintenance costs, and improve development efficiency.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Cloud Container Instance (CCI), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud container application resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for CCI resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated CCI deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent container application management and operation work.

## Best Practices List
