# Introduction

## What is Cloud Eye Service (CES)

Cloud Eye Service (CES) is a monitoring and alarm service provided by Huawei Cloud, used to monitor the running status and performance metrics of cloud resources in real time. CES service supports monitoring of various cloud resources, including Elastic Cloud Server, Elastic Load Balance, Relational Database Service, Object Storage Service, etc., providing rich monitoring metrics, flexible alarm rule configuration and multiple notification methods, helping users discover and handle resource anomalies in time, ensuring stable business operation.

CES service provides real-time monitoring, historical data query, alarm management, custom monitoring and other functions, supports multiple alarm notification methods, including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS callback, etc., with high availability and high reliability. Through CES service, enterprises can fully grasp the running status of cloud resources, achieve proactive operation and intelligent alarm, improve business availability and user experience.

## Best Practice Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Cloud Eye Service (CES) resources, helping you understand how to efficiently manage CES resources on the cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
