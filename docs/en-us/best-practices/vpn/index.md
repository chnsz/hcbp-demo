# Introduction

## What is Virtual Private Network (VPN)

Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a secure and reliable network connection service provided by Huawei Cloud, supporting the establishment of encrypted IPsec VPN connections between VPCs and local networks, enabling interconnection between cloud resources and local data centers. VPN service supports multiple connection methods, including site-to-site VPN, point-to-site VPN, etc., meeting network connection requirements for different scenarios.

VPN service provides complete VPN gateway lifecycle management functions, supporting the creation and configuration of resources such as VPN gateways, VPN connections, and peer gateways, with high reliability and security. Through VPN service, enterprises can easily implement hybrid cloud architectures, ensuring data transmission security and stability, reducing network latency and costs.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Virtual Private Network (VPN), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud VPN resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for VPN resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated VPN deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent VPN gateway, VPN connection management and operation work.
