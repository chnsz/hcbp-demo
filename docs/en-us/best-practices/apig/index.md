# Introduction

## What is API Gateway (APIG)

API Gateway is a high-performance, high-availability, and high-security cloud-native gateway service for enterprises and developers. It can quickly package enterprise service capabilities into standard API interfaces, helping you easily build, manage, and deploy APIs of any scale, and supports API listing on the cloud store for sale. With API Gateway, you can simply, quickly, cost-effectively, and with low risk achieve internal system integration and business capability exposure.

API Gateway provides complete API lifecycle management functionality, supports multiple security authentication and protection mechanisms, has cloud-native gateway capabilities, and can simplify architecture while reducing deployment and operation costs. Through API Gateway, enterprises can quickly achieve business capability exposure, build API ecosystems, and maximize business value.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud API Gateway (APIG), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud API gateway resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the main deployment processes for API gateway resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with automated API gateway deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent API management and operation work.
