# Introduction

## What is Cloud Connect (CC)

Cloud Connect (CC) is a global network connection service provided by Huawei Cloud, supporting multiple network instance access, helping customers build a global network. Cloud Connect service provides full network interconnection capabilities, enabling any two points in the cloud network to interconnect, ensuring one-hop network forwarding without transit. Through Cloud Connect, enterprises can simply and quickly build a unified network architecture across regions and networks.

Cloud Connect service provides simple and flexible configuration methods, enabling minute-level construction of cross-region and cross-border multi-VPC interconnection networks in just three steps, supporting hybrid cloud architectures. Cloud Connect leverages Huawei's global network infrastructure to provide low-latency, high-quality network experience, while providing global one-stop compliant network capabilities, supporting users to focus on their own business innovation.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Cloud Connect (CC), helping you understand how to efficiently manage cloud network connection resources using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
