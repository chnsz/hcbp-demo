# Introduction

## What is Simple Message Notification (SMN)

Simple Message Notification (SMN) is a reliable and scalable message notification service provided by Huawei Cloud, supporting multiple message notification methods including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS, etc. SMN service provides a unified message publishing and subscription mechanism, supporting topic subscription, message push, message filtering, and other functions, helping you achieve message communication between applications and users.

SMN service supports multiple subscription protocols, including email, SMS, HTTP/HTTPS, FunctionGraph, etc., meeting message notification requirements for different scenarios. Through SMN service, you can achieve reliable message delivery, batch push, and flexible subscription, building an efficient message notification system. SMN service also supports integration with Cloud Eye Service (CES) to achieve automated alarm notification sending.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Simple Message Notification (SMN), helping you understand how to efficiently manage SMN resources on the cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the deployment processes of main SMN resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with SMN automated deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent topic management, subscription management, and alarm notification operations.
