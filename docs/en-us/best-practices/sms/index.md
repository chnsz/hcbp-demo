# Introduction

## What is Server Migration Service (SMS)

Server Migration Service (SMS) is a server migration service provided by Huawei Cloud, supporting migration of physical servers, virtual machines, or servers from other cloud platforms to Huawei Cloud, achieving seamless business migration. SMS service provides a complete migration solution, supporting migration of Windows and Linux operating systems, supporting both online migration and offline migration methods, meeting migration requirements for different scenarios.

SMS service supports multiple source environments, including physical servers, virtualization platforms such as VMware, Hyper-V, KVM, XenServer, and mainstream cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Alibaba Cloud. Through SMS service, you can achieve batch server migration, incremental synchronization, and automated deployment, reducing migration costs and risks, and improving migration efficiency. SMS service also supports data consistency and business continuity guarantees during migration, ensuring safe and reliable migration processes.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Server Migration Service (SMS), helping you understand how to efficiently manage SMS resources on the cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
