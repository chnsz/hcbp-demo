# Introduction

## What is Dedicated Host (DEH)

Dedicated Host (DEH) is a physical server resource provided by Huawei Cloud, used to meet business scenarios with special requirements for resource exclusivity, security compliance, etc. Dedicated Host provides full control of physical servers, achieves physical isolation of resources, and meets compliance requirements. Through Dedicated Host, enterprises can deploy ECS instances on dedicated physical servers, obtaining higher security and resource isolation.

Dedicated Host service provides multiple host type options, flexible billing methods, auto placement function, etc., supports prepaid and on-demand billing, with high availability and high reliability. Through Dedicated Host service, enterprises can meet business scenarios with special requirements for resource exclusivity, security compliance, etc., achieving physical isolation and full control of resources.

## Best Practice Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Dedicated Host (DEH) resources, helping you understand how to efficiently manage DEH resources on the cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the deployment process of main DEH resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with DEH automated deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent DEH management and operation work.
