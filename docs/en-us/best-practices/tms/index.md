# Introduction

## What is Tag Management Service (TMS)

Tag Management Service (TMS) is a tag management service provided by Huawei Cloud, supporting adding, modifying, and deleting tags for cloud resources, helping you achieve resource classification management and cost analysis. TMS service provides unified tag management capabilities, supporting batch adding tags to different types of cloud resources (such as ECS, VPC, RDS, etc.), achieving unified classification and identification of resources.

TMS service supports batch tag operations, including batch adding, batch modifying, and batch deleting tags, improving tag management efficiency. Through TMS service, you can achieve resource classification management, cost analysis, and permission control, building an efficient resource management system. TMS service also supports tag policies and tag templates, helping you achieve standardized tag management and automated application.

## Best Practices Overview

This section provides best practice examples for using Terraform to automatically deploy and manage Huawei Cloud Tag Management Service (TMS), helping you understand how to efficiently manage TMS resources on the cloud using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

Through the best practices in this section, you can learn the deployment processes of main TMS resources. These best practices will help you quickly get started with TMS automated deployment and lay a solid foundation for subsequent tag management, resource classification, and cost analysis operations.
